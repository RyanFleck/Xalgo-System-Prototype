# Xalgorithms RM/RT System Prototype No. 4

This React/Django system is the fourth prototype in the series of visual rule editors, and the most complete.
It contains the the code to deploy a frontend and backed from the same
Heroku container for easy sharing, discussion, and iteration.

## Development

Install _Docker Desktop_ on Windows 10/OSX, or docker and docker-compose on GNU/Linux, then run the following
to build and run the system, including all required services, locally:

```sh
docker-compose -f local.yml up
```
