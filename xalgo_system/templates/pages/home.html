<h1>XalgoDevRM</h1>
<br />
<p>
  <b>XalgoDevRM</b> is a developer-oriented local command-line application to author, publish and maintain rules and data on
  the Internet as XRS data packages (Xalgo Rule Schema). XRS data packages can, with a parsing library, run in any
  stand-alone developer (Dev) environment.
</p>
<p>
  <b>XalgoDevRM</b> is intended for deployment across a network that is also comprised of autonomous instances
  XalgoDevRT and XalgoDevRF:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>XalgoDevRT</b> is a developer-oriented library component to fetch, scrutinize, prioritize and, optionally, to
    automate XRS data packages, including diagnostic tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>XalgoDevRF</b> is a developer-oriented local command-line implementation distributed metadata index to identify,
    locate and classify in-effect and applicable XRS data packagess, including diagnostics.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Together the operation of these XalgoDev elements are intended to enable a ‘minimum viable’ reference implementation
  of an Internet of Rules (IoR), oriented to the needs of developers. An IoR is envisioned as a distributed, general
  purpose method for any person to author, publish, discover, fetch, scrutinize, prioritize and optionally automate
  normative rules on digital networks with precision, simplicity, scale, volume and speed. The purpose of an IoR is to
  enable anyone on the network to readily discover and obtain factual knowledge of all available normative rules (MUST,
  MAY and SHOULD, or their various synonyms and negatives) that are ‘in effect’ for their context and ‘applicable’ to
  their particular circumstance.
